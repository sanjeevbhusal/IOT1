                <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive form of dementia. Dementia is a broader term for conditions caused by brain injuries or diseases that negatively affect memory, thinking, and behavior. These changes interfere with daily living.</p>
                <p>According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Most people with the disease get a diagnosis after age 65. If it’s diagnosed before then, it’s generally referred to as early
                    onset Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
                <p>There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, but there are treatments that can slow the progression of the disease.</p>

                <p>Although many people have heard of Alzheimer’s disease, some aren’t sure exactly what it is. Here are some facts about this condition:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic ongoing condition.</li>
                    <li> Its symptoms come on gradually and the effects on the brain are degenerative, meaning they cause slow decline.
                    </li>
                    <li> There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s but treatment can help slow the progression of the disease and may improve quality of life.
                    </li>
                    <li> Anyone can get Alzheimer’s disease but certain people are at higher risk for it. This includes people over age 65 and those with a family history of the condition.
                    </li>
                    <li> Alzheimer’s and dementia aren’t the same thing. Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia.
                    </li>
                    <li> There’s no single expected outcome for people with Alzheimer’s. Some people live a long time with mild cognitive damage, while others </li>

                </ul>

                </div>
                <p>Experts haven’t determined a single cause of Alzheimer’s disease but they have identified certain risk factors, including:</p>
                <p> 1) Age: Most people who develop Alzheimer’s disease are 65 years of age or older.</p>
                <p> 2) Family history: If you have an immediate family member who has developed the condition, you’re more likely to get it.</p>
                <p> 3) Genetics: Certain genes have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.</P>
                <p>Having one or more of these risk factors doesn’t mean that you’ll develop Alzheimer’s disease. It simply raises your risk level.</P>

                </div>


                <p>While there’s no one identifiable cause of Alzheimer’s, genetics may play a key role. One gene in particular is of interest to researchers. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a gene that’s been linked to the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms in older
                    adults.
                </p>
                <p>Blood tests can determine if you have this gene, which increases your risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Keep in mind that even if someone has this gene, they may not get Alzheimer’s.</p>
                <p>The opposite is also true: Someone may still get Alzheimer’s even if they don’t have the gene. There’s no way to tell for sure whether someone will develop Alzheimer’s.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease, which means the symptoms will gradually worsen over time. Alzheimer’s is broken down into seven stages:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Stage 1: There are no symptoms at this stage but there might be an early diagnosis based on family history.</li>
                    <li> Stage 2: The earliest symptoms appear, such as forgetfulness.</li>
                    <li> Stage 3: Mild physical and mental impairments appear, such as reduced memory and concentration. These may only be noticeable by someone very close to the person.</li>
                    <li>Stage 4: Alzheimer’s is often diagnosed at this stage, but it’s still considered mild. Memory loss and the inability to perform everyday tasks is evident.</li>
                    <li>Stage 5. Moderate to severe symptoms require help from loved ones or caregivers.</li>
                    <li>Stage 6: At this stage, a person with Alzheimer’s may need help with basic tasks, such as eating and putting on clothes.
                        <li>
                            <li>Stage 7: This is the most severe and final stage of Alzheimer’s. There may be a loss of speech and facial expressions.</li>

                <p>There’s no known cure for Alzheimer’s disease. However, your doctor can recommend medications and other treatments to help ease your symptoms and delay the progression of the disease for as long as possible.</p>
                <p>For early to moderate Alzheimer’s, your doctor may prescribe medications such as donepezil (Aricept) or rivastigmine (Exelon). These drugs can help maintain high levels of acetylcholine in your brain. This is a type of neurotransmitter
                    that can help aid your memory.</p>
                <p>To treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s, your doctor may prescribe donepezil (Aricept) or memantine (Namenda). Memantine can help block the effects of excess glutamate. Glutamate is a brain chemical that’s released in higher amounts in
                    Alzheimer’s disease and damages brain cells.</p>
                <p>Your doctor may also recommend antidepressants, antianxiety medications, or antipsychotics to help treat symptoms related to Alzheimer’s. These symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> depression
                    </li>
                    <li> restlessness
                    </li>
                    <li> aggression
                    </li>
                    <li> agitation
                    </li>
