                </h2>
                <p>Asthma is a long-term disease of the lungs. It causes your airways to get inflamed and narrow, and it makes it hard to breathe. Severe asthma can cause trouble talking or being active. You might hear your doctor call it a chronic respiratory
                    disease. Some people refer to asthma as "bronchial asthma."</p>
                <p>Asthma is a serious disease that affects about 25 million Americans and causes nearly 1.6 million emergency room visits every year. With treatment, you can live well. Without it, you might have to go to the ER often or stay at the hospital,
                    which can affect your daily life.</p>
                <h2>
                    What is an Asthama Attack?
                </h2>
                <p> asthma attack is the episode in which bands of muscle around the airways are triggered to tighten. This tightening is called bronchospasm. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed, and the cells lining the
                    airways make more and thicker mucus than normal.</p>
                <p>All of these things -- bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production -- cause symptoms such as trouble breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and trouble with normal daily activities.
                </p>
                <p>An asthma attack can get worse quickly, so it's important to treat these symptoms right away. Without immediate treatment, such as with your asthma inhaler or bronchodilator, it will become harder to breathe. If you use a peak flow meter
                    at this time, the reading will probably be less than 50% of your usual or normal peak flow reading
                </p>
                <p> Many asthma action plans suggest interventions starting at 80% of normal. As your lungs continue to tighten, you won’t be able to use the peak flow meter at all. Your lungs will tighten so there is not enough air movement to make wheezing.
                    You need to go to a hospital right away. Unfortunately, some people think that the disappearance of wheezing is a sign of improvement and don’t get emergency care.</p>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <a name="symptoms">Symptoms</a>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asthma is marked by inflammation of the bronchial tubes, with extra sticky secretions inside the tubes. People with asthma have symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus.
                </p>
                <p>There are three major signs of asthma:</p>

                <p>1) Airway blockage: When you breathe as usual, the bands of muscle around your airways are relaxed, and air moves freely. But when you have asthma, the muscles tighten. It’s harder for air to pass through.
                </p>
                <p> 2) Inflammation: Asthma causes red, swollen bronchial tubes in your lungs. This inflammation can damage your lungs. Treating this is key to managing asthma in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>3) Airway irritability: People with asthma have sensitive airways that tend to overreact and narrow when they come into contact with even slight triggers.</p>
                <p>These above mentioned problems may cause symptoms such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coughing, especially at night or in the morning</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Tightness, pain, or pressure in your chest</li>
                    <li>Trouble sleeping because of breathing problems</li>
                    <li>Severe wheezing when breathing both in and out</li>
                    <li>Coughing that won't stop/li>
                        <li>Very rapid breathing</li>
                        <li>Chest pain or pressure</li>
                        <li>Tightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions</li>
                        <li>Difficulty talking</li>
                        <li>Feelings of anxiety or panic</li>
                        <li>Pale, sweaty face</li>
                        <li>Blue lips or fingernails</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. You may not have all of these symptoms, or you may have different symptoms at different times. Your symptoms may also vary from one asthma attack to the next, being mild
                    during one and severe during another. Some people with asthma may go for long periods without having any symptoms. Others might have problems every day. In addition, some people may have asthma only during exercise or with viral infections
                    like colds.

                </div>
                <p>Doctors rank how bad asthma is by its symptoms:</p>
                <p>
                    1. Mild intermittent asthma: Mild symptoms less than twice a week. Nighttime symptoms less than twice a month. Few asthma attacks
                </p>
                <p> 2. Mild persistent asthma: Symptoms three to six times a week. Nighttime symptoms three to four times a month. Asthma attacks might affect activities.</p>
                <p> 3. Moderate persistent asthma: Daily asthma symptoms. Nighttime attacks five or more times a month. Symptoms may affect activities.</p>
                <p> 4. Severe persistent asthma: Ongoing symptoms both day and night. You have to limit your activities.
                </p>
                <P>Your asthma may be getting worse if:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li> You have symptoms more often and they interfere more with your daily life.</li>
                    <li> You have a hard time breathing. You can measure this with a device called a peak flow meter.
                    </li>
                    <li> You need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often.</li>

                <P>There are mainly 3 types of Asthama</P>
                <p>1) Adult-onset asthma: Asthma can start at any age, but it's more common in people younger than 40.
                </p>
                <p>2) Status asthmaticus: These long-lasting asthma attacks don’t go away when you use bronchodilators. They’re a medical emergency that needs treatment right away.</p>
                <p>3) Asthma in children: Symptoms can vary from episode to episode in the same child. Watch for problems like shallow brething, coughing often etc.</p>

                <p>When you have asthma, your airways react to things in the world around you. Doctors call these asthma triggers. They might cause symptoms or make them worse. Common asthma triggers include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infections like sinusitis, colds, and the flu</li>

                        <li>Air pollution</li>
                        <li>Tobacco smoke</li>
                        <li>Exercise</li>

                        <li>Strong emotions such as anxiety, laughter, sadness, or stress</li>
                        <li>Medications such as aspirin</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>Many asthma treatments can ease your symptoms. Your doctor will work with you to make an asthma action plan that will outline your treatment and medications. They might include:</p>
                    <p> 1) Inhaled corticosteroids: These medications treat asthma in the long term. That means you’ll take them every day to keep your asthma under control. They prevent and ease swelling inside your airways, and they may help your body make
                        less mucus. You’ll use a device called an inhaler to get the medicine into your lungs. Common inhaled corticosteroids include Beclomethasone (QVAR), Budesonide (Pulmicort), Fluticasone (Arnuity Ellipta, Armonair Respiclick, Flovent)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2) Leukotriene modifiers: Another long-term asthma treatment, these medications block leukotrienes, things in your body that trigger an asthma attack. You take them as a pill once a day. Common leukotriene modifiers includes Montelukast (Singulair) and
                        Zafirlukast (Accolate)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3) Long-acting beta-agonists: These medications relax the muscle bands that surround your airways. You might hear them called bronchodilators. You’ll take these medications with an inhaler, even when you have no symptoms. They include Ciclesonide (Alvesco),
                        Formoterol (Perforomist), Mometasone (Asmanex), Salmeterol (Serevent)</p>
                    <p> 4) Anticholinergics: These bronchodilators prevent the muscle bands around your airways from tightening. Common ones includes Ipratropium (Atrovent FHA) and Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva)
