                <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source. In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths in is the result of a heart disease. That’s about
                    610,000 people who die from the condition each year.</P>
                <p>Heart disease doesn’t discriminate. It’s the leading cause of death for several populations, including white people, Hispanics, and Black people. Almost half of Americans are at risk for heart disease, and the numbers are rising. </p>
                <p>While heart disease can be deadly, it’s also preventable in most people. By adopting healthy lifestyle habits early, you can potentially live longer with a healthier heart.</p>

                    <a name="symptoms">What are the symptoms of heart disease?</a>
                </h2>


                <p>Different types of heart disease may result in a variety of different symptoms.</p>
                <p>1) Arrhythmias</p>
                <p>Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms. The symptoms you experience may depend on the type of arrhythmia you have — heartbeats that are too fast or too slow. Symptoms of an arrhythmia include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lightheadedness</li>
                    <li>fluttering heart or racing heartbeat</li>
                    <li>slow pulse</li>
                    <li>fainting spells</li>
                    <li>dizziness</li>
                    <li>chest pain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2) Atherosclerosis</p>
                <p>Atherosclerosis reduces blood supply to your extremities. In addition to chest pain and shortness of breath, symptoms of atherosclerosis include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>coldness, especially in the limbs</li>
                    <li>numbness, especially in the limbs</li>
                    <li>unusual or unexplained pain</li>
                    <li>weakness in your legs and arms</li>
                </ul>
                <p>3)Congenital heart defects</p>
                <p>Congenital heart defects are heart problems that develop when a fetus is growing. Some heart defects are never diagnosed. Others may be found when they cause symptoms, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>blue-tinged skin</li>
                    <li>swelling of the extremities</li>
                    <li>shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                    <li>fatigue and low energy</li>
                    <li>irregular heart rhythm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>4)Coronary artery disease (CAD)</p>
                <p>CAD is plaque buildup in the arteries that move oxygen-rich blood through the heart and lungs. Symptoms of CAD include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>chest pain or discomfort</li>
                    <li>a feeling of pressure or squeezing in the chest</li>
                    <li>shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>nausea</li>
                    <li>feelings of indigestion or gas</li>
                </ul>
                <P>5) Cardiomyopathy</p>
                <p>Cardiomyopathy is a disease that causes the muscles of the heart to grow larger and turn rigid, thick, or weak. Symptoms of this condition include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>fatigue</li>
                    <li>bloating</li>
                    <li>swollen legs, especially ankles and feet</li>
                    <li>shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>pounding or rapid pulse</li>
                </ul>
                <p>6) Heart infections</p>
                <p>The term heart infection may be used to describe conditions such as endocarditis or myocarditis. Symptoms of a heart infection include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>chest pain</li>
                    <li>chest congestion or coughing
                    </li>
                    <li>fever</li>
                    <li>chills</li>
                    <li>skin rash</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <p>Women often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than men, specifically with regards to CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.</p>
                <p>In fact, a 2003 study looked at the symptoms most often seen in women who’d experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn’t include “classic” heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and tingling. Instead, the study reported that women
                    were more likely to say they experienced anxiety, sleep disturbances, and unusual or unexplained fatigue.</p>
                <p>What’s more, 80 percent of the women in the study reported experiencing these symptoms for at least one month before their heart attack occurred.</p>
                <p>Symptoms of heart disease in women can also be confused with other conditions, such as depression, menopause, and anxiety.</p>
                <p>Common heart disease symptoms in women include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>dizziness</li>
                    <li>paleness

                    <li>shortness of breath or shallow breathing</li>

                <p>Heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiovascular problems. Several diseases and conditions fall under the umbrella of heart disease. Types of heart disease include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is a heart rhythm abnormality.</li>
                    <li>Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a hardening of the arteries.</li>
                    <li>Cardiomyopathy. This condition causes the heart’s muscles to harden or grow weak.</li>
                    <li>Congenital heart defects. Congenital heart defects are heart irregularities that are present at birth.</li>
                    <li>Coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries. It’s sometimes called ischemic heart disease.</li>
                    <li>Heart infections. Heart infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The term cardiovascular disease may be used to refer to heart conditions that specifically affect the blood vessels.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>
                        <a name="treatment">What treatments are available for heart disease?</a>
                    </h2>
                </div>


                <p>Treatment for heart disease largely depends on the type of heart disease you have as well as how far it has advanced. For example, if you have a heart infection, your doctor is likely to prescribe an antibiotic.</p>
                <p>If you have plaque buildup, they may take a two-pronged approach: prescribe a medication that can help lower your risk for additional plaque buildup and look to help you adopt healthy lifestyle changes.</p>
                <p>Treatment for heart disease falls into three main categories:
                    <p>
                        <p>1) Lifestyle changes</p>
                        <p>Healthy lifestyle choices can help you prevent heart disease. They can also help you treat the condition and prevent it from getting worse. Your diet is one of the first areas you may seek to change.</p>
                        <p>A low-sodium, low-fat diet that’s rich in fruits and vegetables may help you lower your risk for heart disease complications. One example is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.
                            <p>
                                <p>Likewise, getting regular exercise and quitting tobacco can help treat heart disease. Also look to reduce your alcohol consumption.</p>
                                <p>2)Medications</p>
                                <p>A medication may be necessary to treat certain types of heart disease. Your doctor can prescribe a medication that can either cure or control your heart disease. Medications may also be prescribed to slow or stop the risk
                                    for complications. The exact drug you’re prescribed depends on the type of heart disease you have. </p>
                                <p>3) Surgery or invasive procedures</p>
                                <p>In some cases of heart disease, surgery or a medical procedure is necessary to treat the condition and prevent worsening symptoms.</p>
                                <p>For example, if you have arteries that are blocked entirely or almost completely by plaque buildup, your doctor may insert a stent in your artery to return regular blood flow. The procedure your doctor will perform depends
                                    on the type of heart disease you have and the extent of damage to your heart.</p>
